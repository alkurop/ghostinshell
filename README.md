Imagine you have an egg.
The only way to know what's inside is to break it.
Same as egg that can only be broken once.


Because breaking eggs feels violent and  unpleasant, I decided to name the project [Ghost in Shell](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell_(1995_film)) instead.

This is a wrapper with getter that can be called only once
